Yes! You’ve got it. Destructuring works only for objects, not for strings.

🔹 req.body and req.query are objects, so you can destructure them:


const { city, temperature } = req.body;  // ✅ Works (req.body is an object)
const { search } = req.query;  // ✅ Works (req.query is an object)
🔹 req.params.city is a string, so destructuring won't work:


const { city } = req.params.city;  // ❌ Wrong (req.params.city is a string)
Instead, just assign it normally:


const city = req.params.city;  // ✅ Correct
But What About req.params?
👉 req.params itself is an object, so this works:


const { city } = req.params;  // ✅ Works (req.params is an object)
But req.params.city is a string, so you cannot destructure it further.

Golden Rule to Remember
✅ Destructure objects
✅ Directly assign strings, numbers, and booleans
