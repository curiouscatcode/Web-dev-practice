### 🧪 **Task: Build a Simple “Book Reviews App” with session-based auth**

#### 🧩 Requirements:

1. **Auth System (Same as before):**
   - Signup
   - Login
   - Logout
   - Session tracking (userId stored in `req.session.userId`)

2. **Books Table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE books (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Reviews Table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE reviews (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
     book_id INT REFERENCES books(id),
     review TEXT NOT NULL,
     rating INT CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

4. **Routes to build (all protected except signup/login):**
   - `POST /books` → Add a new book  
   - `GET /books` → List all books  
   - `POST /reviews/:bookId` → Add a review to a book  
   - `GET /reviews/:bookId` → See all reviews for a book  

---

🛠 Use sessions just like before.  
If a user is not logged in, they **can’t** add books or post reviews.
