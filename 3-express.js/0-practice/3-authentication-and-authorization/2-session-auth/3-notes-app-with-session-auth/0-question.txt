### 🎯 Task: **Build a Simple “Notes App” with Session Auth**

#### 💡 Idea:
Only logged-in users can create and view their personal notes. Each user sees **only their own notes**.

---

### 🛠️ Features to build:

1. **Signup & Login**  
   - Store users in PostgreSQL  
   - Use sessions for login tracking  

2. **Create Note**  
   - POST `/notes` → Only accessible when logged in  
   - Each note linked to the logged-in user's ID

3. **View Notes**  
   - GET `/notes` → Shows only the notes of that user

4. **Logout**

---

### 🗃️ Database Tables:
- `users` (same as before)
- `notes`  
  ```
  id (PK)
  user_id (FK → users.id)
  content (TEXT)
  created_at (timestamp)
  ```
