## 🧠 Here's a Better Idea:
We’ll build a **session-based authentication system** around a small app idea.

---

### 💡 App Idea: "Club House App"

A small app where:

- People **sign up** to join the Club House.
- Each person can belong to a **Club** (e.g., Book Club, Music Club).
- Logged-in users can:
  - View their profile
  - See which **club** they belong to
  - Change their **club**
- Logged-out users can’t access anything.

---

### 🗃 Database Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE clubs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE members (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  club_id INTEGER REFERENCES clubs(id)
);
```

---

### 🔐 What You'll Learn:
- Sessions
- Cookies
- Login/logout
- Auth-protected routes
- PostgreSQL joins
- Password hashing (`bcryptjs`)

---

### 🧱 Tech Stack:
- Express.js
- `express-session`
- `pg`
- `bcryptjs`
- `dotenv`

Shall we set up the project step-by-step now? Starting with:

✅ 1. Project setup  
✅ 2. Database + tables  
✅ 3. Signup route  
✅ 4. Login + sessions  
✅ 5. Protected routes like `/profile` and `/change-club`

Let me know if you're ready, and we’ll kick off from step 1!
