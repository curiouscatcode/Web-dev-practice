### 🍿 **Movie Review App – Session-Based Auth**

**Goal:**  
Build a simple web API where users can sign up, log in, and post reviews for movies. Only logged-in users can post, edit, or delete their own reviews.

---

### 🚧 Features to Build:

1. **User Auth:**
   - Signup ✅
   - Login ✅
   - Logout ✅
   - Session middleware (reuse what you’ve learned)

2. **Movie Routes (No auth needed):**
   - `GET /movies` – List all movies
   - `GET /movies/:id` – Get movie details

3. **Review Routes (Auth Required):**
   - `POST /movies/:id/reviews` – Add a review
   - `PUT /reviews/:id` – Edit a review (only by author)
   - `DELETE /reviews/:id` – Delete a review (only by author)

4. **Extra:**
   - `GET /movies/:id/reviews` – Get all reviews for a movie

### 🧱 Tables:

```sql
-- Users
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Movies
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT
);

-- Reviews
CREATE TABLE reviews (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
  movie_id INT REFERENCES movies(id),
  review TEXT NOT NULL,
  rating INT CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5)
);
```
