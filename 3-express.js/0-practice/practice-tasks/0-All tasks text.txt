Since you haven’t learned **databases** and **authentication** yet, let’s focus on **strengthening your Node.js & Express skills** with smaller tasks that will help you gain confidence before tackling the invoice generator.  

Here are **5 practical projects** (without databases) that will help you improve step by step:  

---

### **1️⃣ Basic API: Joke Generator**
- Create an Express API that serves **random jokes**.
- Use an array of jokes and return one at random when a user requests `/joke`.  
- Add a `/jokes` endpoint that returns all jokes.  

#### *Concepts Practiced:*  
✅ Creating an Express server  
✅ Handling routes  
✅ Sending JSON responses  

📌 *Extra Challenge:* Add a query parameter like `/joke?category=programming`.  

---

### **2️⃣ File Uploader API (Using Multer)**
- Create an API that allows users to **upload images**.
- Store images in a folder (`uploads/`) and return a URL to access them.  
- Add an endpoint to **list all uploaded files**.  

#### *Concepts Practiced:*  
✅ Handling file uploads with `multer`  
✅ Managing static files in Express  
✅ Handling `POST` requests  

📌 *Extra Challenge:* Limit file types to only images (JPEG, PNG).  

---

### **3️⃣ Simple Notes API**
- Create a `notes.json` file and let users **add, delete, and update notes**.  
- Use `fs` (file system module) to read and write notes instead of a database.  

#### *Concepts Practiced:*  
✅ CRUD operations  
✅ Working with JSON files  
✅ Handling HTTP requests (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)  

📌 *Extra Challenge:* Implement validation (e.g., prevent duplicate notes).  

---

### **4️⃣ HTML Page with Dynamic Data**
- Create an Express server that serves an **HTML page** using `res.sendFile()`.  
- Pass dynamic data (e.g., current time, user’s IP address) into the page.  

#### *Concepts Practiced:*  
✅ Serving static files  
✅ Sending HTML responses  
✅ Using `req` to get user data  

📌 *Extra Challenge:* Use `EJS` or `Pug` templating engine instead of plain HTML.  

---

### **5️⃣ API Rate Limiter**
- Build a middleware that **limits API requests** from a single IP address.  
- If a user exceeds 5 requests per minute, return `429 Too Many Requests`.  

#### *Concepts Practiced:*  
✅ Writing middleware  
✅ Working with request headers (`req.ip`)  
✅ Setting time-based limits (`setTimeout` or `Date.now()`)  

📌 *Extra Challenge:* Use `express-rate-limit` package to enhance it.

### **What Next?**
Once you complete these, you’ll be more comfortable with Express.js. Then, you can move on to:  
- **Databases** (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  
- **Authentication** (JWT, bcrypt)  
- **Your Invoice Generator Project!**
