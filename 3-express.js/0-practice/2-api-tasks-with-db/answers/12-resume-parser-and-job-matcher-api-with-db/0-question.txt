Awesome! Here's your next **CRUD-based project task** â€” a bit more advanced and different from your previous ones:

---

### ðŸ’¼ 12. **Build a Resume Parser & Job Matcher API**

#### ðŸ§  Goal:
Create an API that can:
1. **Upload a resume (PDF)**
2. **Parse** the resume and extract key details (like name, email, skills, experience)
3. **Compare** extracted skills with job listings in your database
4. **Return matching jobs** based on skills

---

### ðŸ“¦ Features to implement:

#### âœ… Resume Upload:
- `POST /upload-resume`  
  Upload a PDF resume and store it temporarily.

#### âœ… Parse Resume:
- Use `pdf-parse` (Node.js) or `PyMuPDF` (Python) to extract:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Skills

#### âœ… Add Jobs to DB:
- `POST /jobs`  
  Add job listings with required skills.

#### âœ… Match Resume to Jobs:
- `GET /match/:user_id`  
  Compare user's skills (from resume) with jobs in DB.
  Return list of best-matching jobs.

### ðŸ—ƒ Suggested Tables:
#### 1. **users**
| id | name | email | parsed_skills |
|----|------|-------|----------------|

#### 2. **jobs**
| id | title | company | required_skills |

- Add `match_score` (how well the resume matches the job)
- Recommend top 3 jobs
- Use tags or keywords for better matching
