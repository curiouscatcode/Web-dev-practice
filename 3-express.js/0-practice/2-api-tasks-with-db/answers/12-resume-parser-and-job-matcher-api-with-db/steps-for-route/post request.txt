Perfect. Let's go step by step. Since weâ€™re not rushing and itâ€™s a bit tough, weâ€™ll build **just one piece at a time**.

## ðŸ§  Step 1: What should `/upload-resume` actually do?

When someone uploads a resume (PDF), what do you *want* to happen?

Letâ€™s break it into substeps:

1. **Receive the PDF file**.
2. **Extract text from it**.
3. **Parse skills from that text** (maybe as keywords like "JavaScript", "Node.js").
4. **Store user info + skills into DB**.

Soâ€¦ letâ€™s first **discuss**:

> ðŸ’­ Do you want the user to upload just the resume?  
Or also give some basic info like `name`, `email`, etc. in the same request?

You decide the flow. Then weâ€™ll plan how to accept that in your route.
