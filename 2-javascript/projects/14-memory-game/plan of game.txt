You're very close! Your steps cover most of the logic, but you can refine them a bit. Here’s an improved step-by-step plan:

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Plan for the Memory Card Game**  

1️⃣ **Create the cards** – Design a grid layout (e.g., 4x4, 3x4).  
2️⃣ **Assign values (images or symbols) to each card** – Ensure each value appears **twice** for matching pairs.  
3️⃣ **Shuffle the cards randomly** at the start of the game.  
4️⃣ **Make the cards interactive** – When clicked, they should "flip" (reveal the value).  
   - You can use **CSS animations** or **add/remove a class** to simulate the flip effect.  
5️⃣ **Allow only two flips at a time**:  
   - **First click** → Flip the first card.  
   - **Second click** → Flip the second card.  
   - If they match, keep them face-up.  
   - If they don’t match, flip them back after a short delay (e.g., 1 second).  
6️⃣ **Prevent clicking the same card twice in a row.**  
7️⃣ **Track the number of moves** (every two flips = 1 move).  
8️⃣ **Check for the win condition** – When all pairs are matched, display a message like **"You Won!"**  
9️⃣ **Add a reset button** to restart the game without reloading the page.
