### 🧩 Mini Project: Simple Todo App (No UI, Just Logic)

**Objective:** Use array methods to implement the logic of a basic todo list.

```js
let todos = [
  { id: 1, task: "Learn React", completed: false },
  { id: 2, task: "Practice JS array methods", completed: true },
  { id: 3, task: "Read a book", completed: false },
];
```

Now write small functions for the following:

1. ✅ **Get all completed tasks**
2. 🔍 **Find task by id**
3. 🚫 **Remove a task by id**
4. ➕ **Add a new task (uncompleted by default)**
5. 🔁 **Toggle a task’s completed status**
6. 📋 **Get a list of only task names sorted alphabetically**

If you can do this comfortably, then you’re in great shape for building dynamic components in React soon!
