Perfect! Since youâ€™ve already done a **book-store API**, the next step is to pick projects that let you practice **different kinds of relationships, authentication, data querying, and more complex CRUD operations**. Hereâ€™s a list of ideas, starting simple and going more advanced:

---

### **1. Movie Database API**    âœ…

* Entities: `Movies`, `Actors`, `Directors`, `Reviews`
* Features:

  * CRUD for movies, actors, and directors
  * Users can post reviews with ratings
  * Search/filter movies by genre, year, rating
  * Relationships: One-to-many (director â†’ movies), many-to-many (movies â†” actors)

---

### **2. Todo/Task Manager API**

* Entities: `Users`, `Tasks`, `Projects`
* Features:

  * User authentication (JWT)
  * Tasks can belong to projects
  * Assign tasks to multiple users
  * Status updates and priority filtering
* Good for practicing authentication and middleware

---

### **3. E-commerce / Shopping API**

* Entities: `Users`, `Products`, `Orders`, `Cart`
* Features:

  * Add/remove items to cart
  * Place orders and update stock
  * Search/filter products
  * Optional: Admin role for managing products
* Teaches role-based access and nested data

---

### **4. Social Media API**

* Entities: `Users`, `Posts`, `Comments`, `Likes`, `Followers`
* Features:

  * User signup/login
  * Post creation and commenting
  * Like/unlike functionality
  * Follow/unfollow users
* Good for practicing **relationships and populating nested references**

---

### **5. Blogging Platform API**

* Entities: `Users`, `Posts`, `Categories`, `Tags`, `Comments`
* Features:

  * CRUD posts with categories and tags
  * Search by tags or categories
  * Commenting system
  * Optional: Likes or ratings
* Helps practice **many-to-many relationships** (tags â†” posts)

---

### **6. Recipe API**

* Entities: `Recipes`, `Ingredients`, `Users`, `Reviews`
* Features:

  * Users can create recipes
  * Recipes have multiple ingredients
  * Users can rate and comment
  * Filter recipes by ingredient or cuisine type
* Good for practicing **nested arrays in MongoDB**

---

### **7. Event Management API**

* Entities: `Events`, `Users`, `Tickets`, `Venues`
* Features:

  * Users can register for events
  * Event capacity tracking
  * Ticket generation
  * Search/filter events by date/location
* Teaches **nested documents and aggregation queries**

---

### **8. Library Management with Borrowing System**

* Entities: `Users`, `Books`, `BorrowRecords`
* Features:

  * Users can borrow/return books
  * Track due dates and fines
  * Admin can add/remove books
* Builds on your book-store API but adds **time-based operations and relations**

---

ðŸ’¡ **Tips to level up your API skills:**

1. Include **authentication (JWT)** and **authorization**.
2. Handle **file uploads** (like user profile pictures or book covers).
3. Use **aggregation pipelines** in MongoDB for stats (e.g., most borrowed books, top-rated recipes).
4. Add **pagination and sorting** in list endpoints.
5. Try **nested population** with Mongoose (`populate()`).

If you want, I can make a **ready-to-use roadmap of 5 APIs in increasing difficulty**, including **what models to create, relationships, and features**â€”so you just pick one and build.

Do you want me to do that?
