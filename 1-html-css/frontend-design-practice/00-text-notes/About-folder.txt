This folder will have me trying to get better at frontend design. 
My goal is to become very good at this. 
For, that i have planned to something. The plan seems like this: 

- Read a book: "Designing with mind in mind" or "hooked" or both 
- (Reading alone won't help) Practice one specific components in different styles.
  I will be practicing one component in different styles and later i am comfortable in 
  everything i will start practicing making full landing pages again.
